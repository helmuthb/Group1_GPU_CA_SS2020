# Group1_GPU_CA_SS2020

This is the repository of group 1 in GPU Computing Architecture 2020.

## Brief summary / guide to the code

Folder `comparison/` is the key folder. It contains the evaluation of the
individual implementations, which are built in their seperate folders.

Folder `base/` contains the base classes used by the implementations: a Graph
data structure, and a random graph generator.

Folder `cpu-version` contains the sequential implementation.

Folder `cuda1` contains the CUDA implementation #1, a.k.a. CUDA1.

Folder `cuda2` contains the CUDA implementation #2, a.k.a. CUDA2.

Folder `thrust` contains the Thrust implementation

Folder `util` contains a number of Python 3 helper scripts, to draw graphs and
to plot the results, for example.
